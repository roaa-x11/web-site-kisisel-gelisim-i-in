          <p class="idea-text">
            Negative emotions can sometimes be so strong that they can take all
            your energy for months or even years. A scientific study conducted
            in Spain observed whether turning emotions into material would cause
            a change in mood. For this purpose, the emotional changes
            experienced by subjects when they wrote their negative thoughts on a
            piece of paper and threw it in the trash were observed. The results
            were surprising. A relief was observed in the psychological states
            of those who put their negative feelings on paper and threw it in
            the trash. It turned out that those who wrote their positive
            feelings on paper felt better.
